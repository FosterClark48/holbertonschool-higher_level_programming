## Background Context
### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:
- Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
- **Don’t trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases

## Resources
- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8)

## Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").\__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").my_function.\__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

## Environment
- Language: Python
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle/Pep8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
