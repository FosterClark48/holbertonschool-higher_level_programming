# 0x04. Python - Classes and Objects
## Resources
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php) (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)

## Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## General requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## More Info
**Documentation is now mandatory!** Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

## Environment
- Language: Python
- OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle/Pep8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
